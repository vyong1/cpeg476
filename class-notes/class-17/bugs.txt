1a.) LUNA.cpp
		- Improper control flow due to lack of braces
		  if(IsLunaMenuStyle())
1b.) notepadapp.cpp
		- The size parameter in memset uses bytes,
		  the size of the array should be 200 bytes
		  because integers are 4 bytes, but memset
		  is only setting 50/200 of the bytes.
1c.) EMULE.cpp
		- *pceltFetched should be in parenthesees,
		  otherwise, it is incrementing the pointer
1d.) cmake.cpp
		- sizeof(doserrors) returns the size in bytes
		  of the array - meaning that the for loop will
		  go on well past the bounds of the array

		  
		  
		  
2.a) v1.cpp
		- If data is negative, then dest[data] will
		  be an illegal access
2.b) v2.cpp
		- The length of cin can be more than CHAR_BUFFER_SIZE,
		  which will cause a buffer overflow
3.c) v3.cpp
		- In the case where realloc returns NULL, the memory
		  is still allocated. In v3.cpp, this memory is never
		  freed in the case that realloc returns NULL, so the
		  program essentially runs out of memory.
3.d) v4.cpp
		- Violates STR34-C: Cast characters to unsigned char 
		  before converting to larger integer sizes
